Samples currently include the following:
 - **GCP Colabs** (Jupyter-style) notebook 
    - for BigQuery (connect & run SQL queries)
    - for BigQueryML (connect, build, train and predict using ML model) IMPORTANT: Use link in each notebook to open it in GCP Colabs environment
    - for TensorFlow w/GPU - speed test  
    - for production workloads, you may want to pay for and use ColabPro ($10/mo) for faster GPU, longer notebook runtimes and more memory

 - **Scripts** and code samples 
    - for BigQueryML in SQL
    - Vision API
    - Natural Language API  
    - for AutoML Vision & Natural Language
    - for Datalab (Jupyter-notebooks on GCE)
    - for TensorFlow 
        - Docker image 
        - Virtual Machine image
        - MLEngine
        - TF Probability
    - Cloud TPUs
